# Just to prove I can do it, here's a loop using iterators.
# ...but man, this hurts my heard for multidimensional arrays.
# Also: if I have to port this to Processing for performance reasons,
# I can't imagine how grateful I'm going to be to my former self
# for adopting C-style loop idioms over more Pythonic approaches.

# for index, heart in enumerate(hearts):
#     print heart, heartlengths[index]
#     for index, beats in enumerate(heart):
#         print heart[index]

# ...and now here's a sane way of producing the same thing:
# print "OUTPUT HEART DATA"
# for i in range(len(hearts)):
#     print "Heart: ", i
#     for j in range(len(hearts[i])):
#         print hearts[i][j]

    # New line, please!

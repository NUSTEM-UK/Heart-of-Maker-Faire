gave me a very good basis to write the following script. Its very similiar, except that I broke out some of the lines of code to make it more understandable for n00bs like myself. I also added a longer "resting" period for the heart to give a slightly more accurate replication. The script lets you set the following: heart rate bpm, length of time of capture, noise added, adc resolution and adc sampling rate.I would recommend installing anaconda to run it. It will install the necessary libraries and give you the excellent Spyder IDE to run it.
